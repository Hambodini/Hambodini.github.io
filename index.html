				<h1>Hi, my name is Trinity Meyers</h1>
				<p>
					I have 2 associates from SCC (southeast community college). one is in business management and HR the
					other is in IT (Information Technology) with a focus on programming.
				</p>
				<p>
					I am a people person and am good at talking and working with new people trying to find out how I can
					help them with their problems and being whatever, they need at that moment. Being such people person
					could explain why I got the management HR degree as my first degree.
				</p>
				<p>
					Ive always been interested in the newest gadgets. Even if I did not have the money for them I would
					research on my own and find out the principle behind them. My interest in all kinds of tech is what
					led to my getting a second degree.

						<h2>Programs</h2>
						<p>
							Here are all the programs I have had a hand in making. They can range from simple
							calculators to responsive webpages like the one you are on now. I was taught PYTHON, JAVA,
							JAVA SERVER, HTML5, C#, C# ASP.NET, SQL, CSS, and JAVASCRIPT. I dipped my toes in all the
							languages so I understand OOP (Object Oriented Programing), which will let me adapt to new
							languages with basic training.

						<h2>Tutoring</h2>
						<p>
							I started to tutor for a part time job after college. It allowed me to keep my people and
							problem-solving skills honed. Each session I had with a student introduced a new problem. It
							was either something I understood and had to find a way to teach it to them or it was a
							problem we both had to work together to solve. I even offer private tutoring (high school to
							college) on request.

						<h2>Academic Life</h2>
						<p>
							All through my time in college I was on the Deans list for having high grades (3.5 or
							higher). I was a good student through and through, being prompt on getting assignments done
							and turned in sometimes a week ahead of the class schedule. Since most of the time, I had my
							work done I would help those in my class that looked like they were struggling.

						<h2>Mouse Game</h2>
						<p>
							I wanted to see if I could make a working game. it is a simple game but I wanted to see if I
							could make a fully functional game with the skills, I learned so far. it is not going to win
							any game of the year awards but I think that it turned out pretty well.

						<h2>Base 64 Converter</h2>
						<p>
							I was very intersted in experimenting with converting a image into a string of text that can be used for other things. it can be stored in a database then when needed the string can be turned back into something that is more human friendly.
